    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade pancakes are a treat, but they are surprisingly simple to whip up. Our easy pancake recipe uses
        ingredients you likely have on hand, like all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, butter, and egg. Start with
        our basic recipe, or try one of our variations using buttermilk or yogurt. Either way, you'll have a fluffy
        stack ready to eat in less than half an hour.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>If you like to make more servings just double or triple the ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened
            whipped cream, or chocolate syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Gather ingredients and have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep
            cooked pancakes warm in the oven.</li>
        <li> In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk
            until just moistened (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half,
            and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.</li>
        <li>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread
            batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</li>
        <li>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue
            with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
